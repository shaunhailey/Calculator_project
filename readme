This is a super simple calculator.
Visually, it is a green box subdivided into a grid of y=5, x=4.
On the top row of the calculator, the x=1/y=1 box is a 'clear' button,
with the other 3 top x-axis buttons acting as the display for the
user inputs.
The remaining 4 x-axis buttons are like the following, stepping
down the y-axis:
789/
456x
123-
0.=+

The y-axis on the 5th x-axis row is a lighter green shade, with black text.
The remainder of the calculator is dark green with white text.

Functionally, each button should push its associated character
to the display via an array. Upon the press of the "=" symbol,
the result of the equation should replace the array in the display.
Alternately, the array and display should be cleared upon user press
of the "C" button.

Initial strategy is to have each button except '=' and 'C' go to an array.
The array must be pushed in real time to the display line. Upon user press
of '=', the array must be converted to proper maths, the array removed from the
display, and replaced by the result of the maths. User input of 'C'  button must
wipe both the array and display.
